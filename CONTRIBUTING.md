## Found a bug?
If this bug is a security vulnerability, please **don't** open an issue and instead refer to our [Security Policy](https://github.com/yesseruser/ypkgupgr/blob/main/SECURITY.md).  

Make sure to search through [issues](https://github.com/yesseruser/ypkgupgr/issues) in case somebody already reported it.  
If nobody reported it, feel free to open an issue [here](https://github.com/yesseruser/ypkgupgr/issues/new?assignees=&labels=bug&projects=&template=bug_report.yml).
Please add a good title and describe the bug as much as possible. Make sure to make the steps to reproduce as clear as possible, since if we can't reproduce the bug, we also most probably can't fix it.
